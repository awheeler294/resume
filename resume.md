Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience. Extensive experience in Rust and Python, 
working in embedded development and back-end web streaming services, with some full-stack
web development experience. I enjoy working at scale, both large and small. I like to build APIs and 
interfaces that are simple to use and easy to understand, backed by automated tests. I love to learn
and expand my technical skills, and I'm open to opportunities outside my core experience.
